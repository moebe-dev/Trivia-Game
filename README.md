A Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.


## Getting Started:
Download the "images" folder to visualize each command given.
This will allow you to better see how the application works.


## Actions & Vision:
* A trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option.

* After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.
The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen,  it shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
